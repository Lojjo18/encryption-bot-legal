# Encryption Bot — Privacy Policy  
Effective Date: 2025-11-28

## 1. Introduction  
This Privacy Policy explains how Encryption Bot (“the Bot”) collects, uses, and handles data when operating on the Discord platform. By using the Bot, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

---

## 2. Data We Do Not Collect  
Encryption Bot is designed to operate with **zero persistent data collection**.

The Bot does NOT collect, store, or log:
- Real names
- Email addresses
- IP addresses
- Private messages
- Message history
- Passwords or credentials
- Financial or payment information
- Location data
- Device identifiers
- Any form of personal profile data

---

## 3. Temporary Technical Processing  
To function correctly within Discord, the Bot temporarily processes the following **in real time only**:

- Discord User ID (to reply to the command sender)
- Discord Server (Guild) ID (to know where the command was sent from)
- Discord Channel ID (to deliver the response)
- The text provided to be encrypted or decrypted

This data:
- Exists **only in system memory**
- Is **not written to any database**
- Is **not logged permanently**
- Is **not reused after the command finishes execution**

---

## 4. How Data Is Used  
Any temporarily processed data is used **only** for:

- Executing the requested encryption or decryption command
- Sending the output back to the user
- Preventing runtime errors

The Bot does NOT:
- Track users
- Profile users
- Perform analytics
- Perform behavioral tracking
- Share anything externally

---

## 5. Data Storage  
Encryption Bot does **not maintain a user database** and does **not store historical records** of:

- Encrypted text
- Decrypted text
- Command history
- User activity

If short-term debugging logs are generated during development:
- They contain **no message content**
- They contain **no personal identifiers**
- They are deleted after debugging is complete

---

## 6. Data Sharing  
Encryption Bot:

- Does **not sell** data  
- Does **not rent** data  
- Does **not share** data  
- Does **not transmit** data to third parties  
- Does **not integrate** with external processors  

All encryption operations occur within the bot’s own execution environment.

---

## 7. User Rights  
Since no personal data is persistently stored:

- There is no personal dataset to request
- There is no user profile to export
- There is no stored history to delete

However, users may still contact the developer for privacy-related inquiries.

---

## 8. Children’s Privacy  
Encryption Bot does not knowingly collect data from children.  
Usage of the Bot is governed by Discord’s own minimum age requirements.  

By using the Bot, you confirm that you comply with Discord’s age limits.

---

## 9. Security Disclaimer  
While reasonable technical measures are used to ensure correct operation, **no encryption method implemented in a Discord bot environment should be considered suitable for high-risk security use cases**, including but not limited to:

- Banking credentials  
- Government or classified data  
- Medical or legal records  

Use of the Bot for sensitive security-critical data is strictly at your own risk.

---

## 10. Policy Changes  
This Privacy Policy may be updated in the future if the Bot gains:

- Databases
- User accounts
- Web dashboards
- Persistent logging
- External integrations

When changes occur, the Effective Date will be updated. Continued use of the Bot constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.

---

## 11. Contact  
For privacy-related questions or concerns, please contact the developer via the official contact method listed on the Bot’s Top.gg page.
